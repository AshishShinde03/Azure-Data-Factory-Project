## Project Objective
Building a Azure Cloud Data Platform for Data Scientists to Predict the covid19 outbreak and for Data Analyst for reporting and visualiation.

## Step by step Objectives
	1. Data Lake to be built with the following data to aid Data Scientists to predict the spread of the virus/ mortality
		Confirmed cases
		Mortality
		Hospitalization/ ICU Cases
		Testing Numbers
		Countryâ€™s population by age group
	2. Data Warehouse to be built with the following data to aid Reporting on Trends
		Confirmed cases
		Mortality
		Hospitalization/ ICU Cases
		Testing Numbers

  

## Data Sources
	1. ECDC Website -> https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/covid-19/data
		Confirmed cases
		Mortality
		Hospitalization/ ICU Cases
		Testing Numbers
		
	2. Eurostat Website -> https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/estat-navtree-portlet-prod/BulkDownloadListing?file=data/tps00010.tsv.gz
		Population by age

## Data Ingestion
1. Population by Age data: Ingestion from Azure Blob Storage to Azure Data Lake using copy activity
